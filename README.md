-Introduces a new Cleric kit, the Oozelord
	
        Oozelord Kit Info
		
                Followers of Ghuanadar, Zargon, or Juiblex are uncommon but not unheard of among humanoids. Especially devout followers become oozelords, doing their best to ensure the dominance of slime and ooze on the Material Plane.

	of the immunities of an ooze, but does not gain magic 
	resistance.
        
	-Gains unique High Level Abilities.
	
        Disadvantages 
	
                -Thanks to his or her revolting meld with ooze, the 
	          oozelord takes a -8 penalty to Charisma.
	
                -Loses all Cure and Cause wounds spells.
	
                -Alignment restricted to True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, 
	           Neutral Evil, or Chaotic Evil.~
        
-Makes Oozes immune to Constitution and Intelligence drain given that the two sources of those that I have come across (Illithid brain-drain and Vampire blooddrinking)
rely on anatomical parts that Oozes lack completely (brains, and blood, respectively).

-Makes Mustard Jellies and Ochre Jellies have melee weapons rather than ranged ones; it makes no sense for an ooze to have such severe penalties to THAC0 when it is striking with its body. Gray oozes maintain their ranged weapon.

Version History:

Version 1.0: Initial Release

Version 1.1: Fixed Oozelords not losing the right spells and not really losing the spells (Hopefully), changed Cha penalty to -8 in the hopes that rerolling wouldn't cause so much lag (this seems to have worked). Added a holy symbol for the Oozelord. Changed Bone Ooze and Teratomorph ability drain to not be permanent. Also fixed Mustard Jellies not being able to attack.

Version 1.2: Hopefully fixed HLA table, fixed non-oozelords getting oozelord spells, fixed oozelords not getting Summon Ooze VIII or IX at all (hopefully) thanks to a copy/paste error in 2DA, fixed Infernal Conflagration Oozes being invisible all the time. Fixed oozelords not losing Cause Light Wounds in BG2EE

Version 1.3: Fixed Infernal Conflagration Oozes, Mustard Jellies, and Ochre Jellies not attacking. Fixed Infernal Conflagration oozes not actually doing fire damage with their attacks.

Version 1.4: Unified the BGEE and BG2EE branches of the mod, ensured EET compatibility
